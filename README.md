#PrettyPress - Making Wordpress composition simple and beautiful.

PrettyPress is an MIT licensed Wordpress plugin that focuses on simplifying the default Wordpress publishing layout.
It aims to be simple and encourage users to focus on writing - without other un-necessary distractions.

##Live preview window as you type

PrettyPress provides you with a live preview of how your post will look on the front end of the site, as you type.
It uses some little javascript and jQuery hacks to do this - Bigger posts may be plagued by performance issues.
This is an issue to be worked on in the near future.

###Known issues

PrettyPress is still in very early development, and thus, there are known issues.

*	Wordpress themes that use the_title() in place of the_title_attribute() may break in the preview window.
*	Shortcodes are currently not executed in live preview.
*	PrettyPress is not very backwards browser compatible as of yet.
